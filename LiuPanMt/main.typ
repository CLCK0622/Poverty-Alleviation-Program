= Introduction

The development of China's contiguous poverty-stricken regions has consistently constituted a crucial part of the national poverty alleviation initiative. Notably, the LiuPan Mountain (六盘山) Area, as a representative region within this belt, has long faced with challenges such as inconvenient transportation and scarce resources. As China intensifies its efforts in the poverty alleviation campaign, the key role of transportation in poverty reduction is becoming increasingly apparent, especially in regions like the LiuPan Mountain Area. This paper aims to delve into the mechanisms through which transportation functions in the poverty reduction process in this area, exploring its positive impacts on the local economy, society, and the well-being of people there.

In the era of globalization and informatization, transportation is considered the belt connecting regions internally and externally, playing an irreplaceable role in fostering economic prosperity and social progress. Particularly in impoverished regions, optimizing transportation infrastructure and enhancing transportation efficiency not only facilitates the comprehensive utilization of local resources but also contributes to breaking down information barriers, propelling market-oriented processes, and providing robust support for poverty alleviation and wealth generation.

The transportation challenges faced by the LiuPan Mountain Area are not merely localized predicaments; they represent a critical part of constructing a socialist modernized nation comprehensively. By meticulously examining the practical role of transportation in poverty alleviation, we can gain a better understanding of its contribution to sustainable development in impoverished regions. Consequently, this paper aims to provide sensible recommendations for future development in the LiuPan Mountain Area through a comprehensive analysis of its transportation system.
