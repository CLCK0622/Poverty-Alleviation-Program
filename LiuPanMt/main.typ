= Introduction

The development of China's contiguous poverty-stricken regions has consistently constituted a crucial part of the national poverty alleviation initiative. Notably, the LiuPan Mountain (六盘山) Area, as a representative region within this belt, has long faced with challenges such as inconvenient transportation and scarce resources. As China intensifies its efforts in the poverty alleviation campaign, the key role of transportation in poverty reduction is becoming increasingly apparent, especially in regions like the LiuPan Mountain Area. This paper aims to delve into the mechanisms through which transportation functions in the poverty reduction process in this area, exploring its positive impacts on the local economy, society, and the well-being of people there.

In the era of globalization and informatization, transportation is considered the belt connecting regions internally and externally, playing an irreplaceable role in fostering economic prosperity and social progress. Particularly in impoverished regions, optimizing transportation infrastructure and enhancing transportation efficiency not only facilitates the comprehensive utilization of local resources but also contributes to breaking down information barriers, propelling market-oriented processes, and providing robust support for poverty alleviation and wealth generation.

By meticulously examining the practical role of transportation in poverty alleviation, we can gain a better understanding of its contribution to sustainable development in impoverished regions. Consequently, this paper aims to provide sensible recommendations for future development in the LiuPan Mountain Area through a comprehensive analysis of its transportation system.

= Impact on Poverty Alleviation of Transportation

Enhancing transportation infrastructure in the LiuPan Mountain Area facilitates the more convenient entry of agricultural products into the market, thereby promoting the development of the rural economy. Strengthening transportation connections not only aids in tapping into new markets but also propels industrial upgrading, providing additional economic opportunities for impoverished regions.

When delving into the relationship between market openness and industrial development, our initial focus is on the interaction between the key industries in the LiuPan Mountain Area and transportation. According to available data, over the past decade, the development of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, including the core impoverished belt within the LiuPan Mountain Area, has witnessed significant growth in the secondary and tertiary industries, becoming the main engines of economic growth, with the primary industry following closely behind. However, the industrial structure of the LiuPan Mountain Area remains predominantly agrarian, indicating a substantial share of agriculture in the local economy.

Transportation plays a pivotal role in market openness and industrial development. Firstly, by improving the road and rail networks, the transportation cost of agricultural products is reduced, and efficiency is enhanced. This makes it easier for agricultural products from the LiuPan Mountain Area to circulate to urban centers and other regions, breaking geographical barriers and expanding market reach.

Specifically, potential key industries in the LiuPan Mountain Area, such as agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, can benefit from the support of transportation infrastructure. Products can be more efficiently transported to markets, boosting sales and contributing to increased income for farmers. This, in turn, aids in poverty reduction and aligns with the overarching goal of achieving sustainable development.

Furthermore, the development of transportation infrastructure in the LiuPan Mountain Area should prioritize supporting the development of local distinctive industries and leveraging advantageous resources. Through the strategic planning of transportation routes, better service to local industry chains can be achieved, promoting industrial upgrading and adding value to products.

In conclusion, the close connection between market openness and industrial development necessitates robust support from transportation infrastructure. Through an in-depth examination of the industrial structure and transportation development in the LiuPan Mountain Area, we can provide more targeted recommendations for future policy formulation and project planning, fostering sustainable poverty alleviation and development in the region.
