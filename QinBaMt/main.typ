  abstract: [This paper examines the role of transportation in poverty alleviation efforts within the Liupan Mountain Area of China. It argues that improved transportation infrastructure unlocks market access for agricultural products, fosters industrial development, and ultimately boosts incomes and well-being in impoverished regions. By analyzing the interplay between market openness, industrial structure, and strategic transportation planning, the paper provides recommendations for sustainable poverty reduction initiatives in the Liupan Mountain Area.],
